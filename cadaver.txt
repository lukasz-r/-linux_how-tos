# connecting to a remote server and putting the file index.html into it:
cd ~/ou-www
cadaver https://files.oakland.edu/users/bryant/
put index.html
# Remember that "remote" means the server you are connected to and "local" means your machine! That is why you use "put" for upload (local machine > remote server) and "get" for download (remote server > local machine)!
